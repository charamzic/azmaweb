                                In 2022, I made a significant career transition into programming, starting with Java as my foundation language.
                                This decision marked the beginning of an exciting journey in software development and technology.
                                What began as learning Java fundamentals quickly expanded into exploring the broader ecosystem of modern development.
                                I discovered my passion for building complete applications—not just writing code, but creating solutions that are
                                both functional and visually appealing.
                                Currently, I'm expanding my skills into Python for its versatility in automation and data processing,
                                and React Native for cross-platform mobile development. I believe in the power of diverse technologies
                                to solve different problems effectively.
                                Today, I work as a DevOps Engineer at Deutsche Böerse Group, where I focus on improving development workflows,
                                implementing CI/CD pipelines, and bridging the gap between development and operations teams.

                                When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects,
                                and staying connected with the developer community. I believe that the best solutions come from
                                collaboration and sharing knowledge.
                                My transition into programming has taught me that it's never too late to pursue your passion.
                                Every challenge is an opportunity to grow, and every project is a chance to create something meaningful.
