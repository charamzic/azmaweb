about.page.title=About me
about.page.subtitle=My journey from career transition to DevOps
about.description.title=From new beginnings to devops excellence
about.description=In 2022, I made a significant career transition into programming, starting with Java as my foundation language. This decision marked the beginning of an exciting journey in software development and technology. What began as learning Java fundamentals quickly expanded into exploring the broader ecosystem of modern development. I discovered my passion for building complete applications ‚Äî not just writing code, but creating solutions that are both functional and visually appealing.<br><br> Currently, I'm expanding my skills into Python for its versatility in automation and data processing, and React Native for cross-platform mobile development. I believe in the power of diverse technologies to solve different problems effectively. Today, I work as a DevOps Engineer at Deutsche B√∂erse Group, where I focus on improving development workflows, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and bridging the gap between development and operations teams.

about.beyond.code.description=When I'm not at the computer, I try to stay active. I even retrained as a carpenter and immediately got involved in building a traditional timber house under the guidance of an experienced craftsman from South Bohemia. Timber framing, log houses, and manual work without too much help from machines are close to my heart and something I really enjoy.<br><br>I'm also into sports‚Äîoriginally mostly combat sports, from judo and BJJ to boxing and Muay Thai. Later I got into climbing and via ferratas. These days, I try to exercise regularly at home or at the gym, or at least go for a walk. I‚Äôll gradually share more about all my projects on the blog.
